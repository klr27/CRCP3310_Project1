# Data: Narrative, Meaning, and Discovery Project 1
Create a visualization of Lewis Carroll’s Alice in Wonderland, using Java and the Processing environment.

## Requirements
1. Each instance of a particular character should be colored the same. The colors are up to you, and this should not be case sensitive. For example, all A’s and a’s should be chartreuse.
2. Each occurrence of the word Alice should be highlighted in some fashion.
3. Spaces and non-alpha characters should all be the same color (eg. black).
4. The program should display the number of times that Alice occurs in the text.
5. When the user clicks on the screen, the program should display a simple visualization that communicates the frequency of each character in the text. This second visualization should also communicate the least frequent character, and the most frequent character.
6. Your program should treat the data as a stream, and use a java.io.BufferedReader.
